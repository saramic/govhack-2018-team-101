### Introduction

Hi we are team 101, we've had a great time putting together our Story Board generator
for this years Gov Hack 2018. We have taken a different angle on joining disperate data
sets and sharing the data with a new and engaged audience, kids.

What better way to bring data together than with a fine tuned AI, heck make it real
school aged kids, gamifying the process of joining data from various sources across
varied dimentions into a pleasant story of their surrounds. A story they can share with
their peers, a story that is backed by data relevant to their community and Australia
overall. And what better way to spread the importance of open data initiatives to Australians
and the next generation? Rather then telling them about it, show them and let them create
and show to others their own story books


### App run through

So, let's get started.

11 year old Matilda lives in the seaside City of Kingston where her story begins...

She goes to Parkdale primary school and has already added this to the first frame of her comic
book story

Clicking on the info button reveals the data source of this part of the story - in this
case of schools it is the data.vic School locations data. 
Matilda can see there are a lot of schools nearby, including _____ that one of her friends
goes to.

At school, Matilda loves to play ball sports and when prompted she wanted to add that to her
story too

Outdoor sports takes Matilda to a nearby park

[child reading] "At the park I saw some rubbish so I picked it up and I put it in the bin" - 
this brings in data from ... and suddenly Matilda can link the data from nearby sports areas 
to the recycling data source - amazing.

Let's click on the + add button and see what's next in Matilda's story.
