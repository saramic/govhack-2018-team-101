Introduction

Hi we are team 101 and have had a great time putting together our Story Board generator
for this years Gov Hack 2018. We have taken a different angle on joining disperate data
sets and sharing the data with a new and engaged audience, kids.

What better way to bring data together then with a fine tuned AI, heck make it real
school aged kids, gamifying the process of joining data from various sources across
varied dimentions into a pleasant story of their surounds. A story they can share with
their peers, a story that is backed by data relevant to their community and Australia
overall. And what better way to spread importance of open data initiatives to Australians
and the next generation rather then telling them about it, show them and let them create
and show to others story books they create

So let's get started.

Let's imagine we are 11 year old Matilda living in the seaside City of Kingston going
to 5th grade in primary school. She can navigate to her already started story. A great
place to start is at her school. She goes to Parkdale primary school. This can be seen
in the first frame of the comic book like feel of story bory board generator

At any time the info button can clicked to review the data source the we have been lucky
to use. In the case of schools it is the data.vic School locations data. Let's click and
have a look in more details. As we can see there are a lot of schools around Matilda's
Parkdale Primary.

So from school Matilda was prompted to play some ball sports. She thought this was a
good idea and swiped right to accept and add this to her story.

[read] "at the park she saw some rubbish and decided to put it in the bin" - this brings
in data from ... and allows the child to link the data from the sports areas to the
recycling data source - amazing.

Let's click on the + add button and see what's next in Matilda's story.
