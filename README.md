### Introduction

Hi we are team 101, we've had a great time putting together our Story Board generator
for this years Gov Hack 2018. We have taken a different angle on joining disperate data
sets and sharing the data with a new and engaged audience, kids.

What better way to bring data together than with a fine tuned AI, heck make it real
school aged kids, gamifying the process of joining data from various sources across
varied dimentions into a pleasant story of their surrounds. A story they can share with
their peers, a story that is backed by data relevant to their community and Australia
overall. And what better way to spread the importance of open data initiatives to Australians
and the next generation? Rather then telling them about it, show them and let them create
and show to others their own story books


### App run through

So, let's get started.

11 year old Matilda lives in the seaside City of Kingston where her story begins...

She goes to Parkdale primary school and has already added this to the first
frame of her comic book story.

Matilda loves to play ball sports. Using the sport and recreational facilities
dataset, the app suggests a soccer field nearby. Matilda chooses to add it to
her story.

[child reading] "At the park I saw some rubbish so I picked it up and I put it in the bin" -
this brings in data from the LCA kerbside recycling calculator, helping Matilda
understand the positive environmental impact of her actions.

Let's click on the + add button and see what's next in Matilda's story:

Matilda encounters an elderly gentleman, which is linked to an aged care dataset,
where she discovers that 1 in 3 older people were born in a non-English speaking country.

She skips a few suggestions, choosing to follow this train of thought further.

The next panel is linked to the 2016 census community profiles, which cover a
wide range diverse ethnic characteristics.

Matilda is asked a question about gender equality, giving her the opportunity
to explore the average Average hourly earnings of female and male employees by occupation.

The next suggestion prompts her: "What would you like to do when you grow up?"
This panel leads her to the employment projections dataset.

In the final panel, Matilda is given the opportunity to learn about the social
and emotional wellbeing of indigenous Australians.
