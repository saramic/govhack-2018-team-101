   * storyElements is a directed graph of all the paths a story could potentially take, like a "choose your own adventure".
   *
   * Example story building exercise, to illustrate the data structure below:
   *
   *  - Tinder card is shown with a picture of a soccer ball.
   *  - User accepts the card, and is shown the details: "I was walking past a soccer field, and saw people speaking Italian..."
   *  - User is happy, and then proceeds to add it to the comic strip.
   *  - The comic strip preview now includes a card with:
   *    * A picture of a soccer ball
   *    * The text "I was walking past a soccer field, and saw people speaking Italian..."
   *  - The user adds a new tinder card, and are shown a picture of Carlton Gardens (because that is one potential segue).
   *  - They accept the gardens picture, and so are shown the details "Carlton gardens is great because... blah blah".
   *  - Because they accepted this, we now update the previous card and tell it what the segue is, "A suburb with lots of italians is Carlton, which also has wonderful gardens".
   *  - The comic strip preview now includes the following cards:
   *    * "I was walking past a soccer field, and saw people speaking Italian. A suburb with lots of italians is Carlton, which also has wonderful gardens" (Note the segue is now included).
   *    * "Carlton gardens is great because... blah blah" (Note: No segue included, because we don't know where we are segueing to yet...)
